This is a useful page I found with enough detailing on FOSS for NGOs - [__awesome-ngo__](https://github.com/thiras/awesome-ngo)

It's a little dated, however, with the README being 3 years old, so I investigated to find the latest state of each of them. I'm only listing the status here and not linking the tools themselves - the awesome page on the repo linked above is where you should head to for links to these tools.

these are actually free and friendly to learn
- __SyncThing__ - website is functional. really nice documentation. free tier has good functionality.

these are more fremium than free
- __Doodle__ - website is functional. free tier has limited functionality.
- __NextCloud__ - website is functional. free tier has limited functionality.

these are no longer free (no free tier)
- __Loomio__ - forums & collaborative decision making. Free alternative -
